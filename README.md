## Strategies

14 built-in strategies across four categories. Every strategy extends `BaseStrategy` with a single `on_tick()` method — no shared state, no hidden coupling between strategies.

### Market Making

Provide two-sided liquidity and earn the spread. These strategies quote bids and asks around a fair value estimate, managing inventory risk through skew and sizing adjustments.

| Strategy | Description | Key Parameters | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| `engine_mm` | Production quoting engine — composite 4-signal fair value, dynamic spreads (fee + vol + toxicity + event), inventory skew, multi-level quote ladder. Auto-halts on oracle staleness. *Requires `quoting_engine` module.* | `base_size`, `num_levels` | Primary MM strategy. Handles all market conditions including volatile regimes and stale data. |
| `avellaneda_mm` | Avellaneda-Stoikov optimal market maker. Reservation price adjusts with inventory; optimal spread from risk aversion `gamma` and order flow intensity `k`. Vol-bin classifier + drawdown amplifier. | `gamma`, `k`, `base_size` | When you want theoretically grounded inventory-aware quoting with well-understood parameters. |
| `regime_mm` | Vol-regime adaptive — classifies market into 4 volatility regimes (quiet/normal/volatile/extreme), switches spread width, sizing, and aggressiveness per regime. *Requires `quoting_engine` module.* | `base_size` | Volatile markets where a single spread width doesn't work. Auto-adapts without manual tuning. |
| `simple_mm` | Symmetric bid/ask quoting at fixed spread around mid. No inventory adjustment. | `spread_bps`, `size` | Testnet validation, baseline benchmarking, or low-vol stable pairs. |
| `grid_mm` | Fixed-interval grid levels above and below mid. Places N orders at equal spacing. *Requires `quoting_engine` module.* | `grid_spacing_bps`, `num_levels`, `size_per_level` | Range-bound markets where you want to accumulate and distribute across a price band. |
| `liquidation_mm` | Provides liquidity during cascade/liquidation events. Detects OI drops and widens spreads to capture forced-seller flow. *Requires `quoting_engine` module.* | `oi_drop_threshold_pct`, `cascade_spread_mult` | Liquidation-heavy markets. Only active during cascade conditions — sits idle otherwise. |

### Arbitrage

Exploit pricing dislocations across venues, instruments, or time horizons.

| Strategy | Description | Key Parameters | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| `funding_arb` | Cross-venue funding rate arbitrage — captures funding divergence between HL and external venues. Quoting-engine powered with bias from funding delta. *Requires `quoting_engine` module.* | `divergence_threshold_bps`, `max_bias_bps` | When funding rates diverge between venues. Works well on high-funding instruments. |
| `basis_arb` | Trades implied basis from funding rate — enters when annualized basis (contango/backwardation) exceeds threshold. | `basis_threshold_bps`, `size` | Capturing contango/backwardation dislocations. Pairs well with funding_arb. |

### Signal / Directional

Enter positions based on technical signals or momentum indicators.

| Strategy | Description | Key Parameters | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| `momentum_breakout` | Enters on volume + price breakout above/below N-period range. Requires both price and volume confirmation. | `lookback`, `breakout_threshold_bps`, `size` | Trending markets with clear breakout patterns. |
| `mean_reversion` | Trades when price deviates from SMA beyond a threshold. | `window`, `threshold_bps`, `size` | Range-bound markets with predictable mean-reversion behavior. |
| `aggressive_taker` | Crosses the spread with directional bias. Sinusoidal amplitude modulation. | `size`, `bias_amplitude` | When you have strong directional conviction and want immediate fills. |

### Infrastructure / Risk

Supporting strategies for portfolio management, block liquidity, and autonomous decision-making.

| Strategy | Description | Key Parameters | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| `hedge_agent` | Reduces excess exposure per deterministic mandate. Fires when net notional exceeds threshold. | `notional_threshold` | Always-on risk overlay. Pairs with any MM or signal strategy. |
| `rfq_agent` | Block-size dark RFQ liquidity — quotes for large orders with wider spreads. | `min_size`, `spread_bps` | Institutional/block flow. Provides hidden liquidity for large counterparties. |
| `claude_agent` | Multi-model LLM trading agent. Sends market snapshot to an LLM (Gemini, Claude, or OpenAI), receives structured trade decisions. | `model`, `base_size` | Experimental/research. Autonomous decision-making using LLM reasoning. |

### Quoting Engine Pipeline

The engine-powered strategies (`engine_mm`, `funding_arb`, `regime_mm`, `liquidation_mm`) share a common pipeline:

```
Market Data -> Composite Fair Value -> Dynamic Spread -> Inventory Skew -> Multi-Level Ladder -> Orders
               (4-signal blend)       (fee+vol+tox)     (price+size)     (exponential decay)
```

### LLM Agent (Multi-Model)

| Provider | Models | Env Variable |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Google Gemini | `gemini-2.0-flash` (default), `gemini-2.5-pro` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| Anthropic Claude | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_SESSION_TOKEN` |
| OpenAI | `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `o3-mini` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |

### Guard — Dynamic Stop Loss

Trailing stop system with tiered profit-locking. Protects profits while letting winners run.

**Two phases:**
- **Phase 1 (Let it breathe)** — Wide retrace tolerance while position builds. Auto-cut at 90 min if no graduation; weak-peak early cut at 45 min if peak ROE < 3%.
- **Phase 2 (Lock the bag)** — Tiered profit floors that ratchet up as ROE grows. Exchange-level stop loss synced to Hyperliquid as crash safety net.

| Preset | Phase 1 Retrace | Tiers | Stagnation TP |
|--------|----------------|-------|---------------|
| `moderate` | 3% | 6 tiers (10-100% ROE) | No |
| `tight` | 5% | 4 tiers (10-75% ROE) | Yes (8% ROE, 1h) |

```bash
hl guard run -i ETH-PERP --preset tight
```

**[Download SKILL.md](skills/guard/SKILL.md)**

---

### Radar — Opportunity Radar

Multi-factor screening engine that evaluates all HL perps for trade setups. 4-stage funnel, scores 0-400.

| Pillar | Weight | Signals |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Market Structure | 35 | Volume, OI, liquidity |
| Technicals | 30 | RSI, EMA, patterns, hourly trend |
| Funding | 20 | Rate extremes, direction bias |
| BTC Macro | 15 | Trend alignment, regime filter |

```bash
hl radar once --mock    # Single scan
hl radar run --mock     # Continuous (every 15 min)
```

**[Download SKILL.md](skills/radar/SKILL.md)**

---

### Pulse — Emerging Momentum Detector

Detects assets with sudden capital inflow using OI, volume, funding, and price signals. Runs every 60 seconds.

**5-tier signal taxonomy** for entry classification, plus informational signals for Radar scoring:

| Tier | Signal | Trigger | Confidence |
|------|--------|---------|------------|
| 1 | `FIRST_JUMP` | First asset in sector with OI + volume breakout | 100 |
| 2 | `CONTRIB_EXPLOSION` | OI +15% **AND** volume 5x (simultaneous extreme) | 95 |
| 3 | `IMMEDIATE_MOVER` | OI +15% **OR** volume 5x (either extreme) | 80 |
| 4 | `NEW_ENTRY_DEEP` | OI grows 8%+ but volume stays low — smart money accumulation | 65 |
| 5 | `DEEP_CLIMBER` | Sustained OI climb 5%+ per window over 3+ consecutive scans | 55 |
| — | `VOLUME_SURGE` | 4h volume / average > 3x | 70 |
| — | `OI_BREAKOUT` | OI jumps 8%+ above baseline | 60 |
| — | `FUNDING_FLIP` | Funding rate reverses or accelerates 50%+ | 50 |

```bash
hl pulse once --mock      # Single scan
hl pulse run --mock       # Continuous (every 60s)
```

**[Download SKILL.md](skills/pulse/SKILL.md)**

---

### APEX — Autonomous Multi-Slot Strategy

The top-level orchestrator. Composes Radar + Pulse + Guard into a single autonomous strategy managing 2-3 concurrent positions.

**Tick schedule** (60s base):
- Every tick: Fetch prices, update ROEs, check Guard, run Pulse, evaluate entry/exit
- Every 5 ticks: Watchdog health check
- Every 15 ticks: Run opportunity radar

**Entry priority** (tier-based):

| Priority | Source | Condition |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | FIRST_JUMP | First sector mover (tier 1) |
| 2 | CONTRIB_EXPLOSION | Simultaneous extreme OI + volume (tier 2) |
| 3 | Smart money | Pulse confidence > 90 |
| 4 | IMMEDIATE_MOVER | Either extreme metric (tier 3) |
| 5 | Radar | Score > 170 |
| 6 | NEW_ENTRY_DEEP | Limit-order accumulation (tier 4) |
| 7 | DEEP_CLIMBER | Sustained OI trend (tier 5) |

**Presets:**

| Preset | Slots | Leverage | Radar Threshold | Daily Loss Limit |
|--------|-------|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| `default` | 3 | 10x | 170 | $500 |
| `conservative` | 2 | 5x | 190 | $250 |
| `aggressive` | 3 | 15x | 150 | $1,000 |

```bash
hl apex run --mock --max-ticks 10          # Mock test
hl apex run                                 # Live testnet
hl apex run --preset conservative --mainnet # Live mainnet
```

### REFLECT — Performance Review

Nightly self-improvement loop. Reads trade history, computes metrics, detects patterns, generates actionable recommendations.

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Win Rate | % of round trips with positive net PnL |
| FDR | Fee Drag Ratio — fees as % of gross wins |
| Direction Split | Long vs short win rates and PnL |
| Holding Periods | Bucketed by <5m, 5-15m, 15-60m, 1-4h, 4h+ |
| Monster Dependency | % of net PnL from best single trade |

```bash
hl reflect run --since 2026-03-01
hl reflect report
hl reflect history -n 10
```

**[Download SKILL.md](skills/reflect/SKILL.md)**

### REFLECT Self-Improvement Loop

When running inside APEX, REFLECT executes automatically every 240 ticks (~4 hours) and at a configurable UTC hour (default 04:00). It reads the trade log, computes performance metrics, and **auto-adjusts APEX parameters** based on findings:

| Finding | Automatic Adjustment |
|---------|---------------------|
| FDR > 30% (fees eating profits) | Raise radar threshold, disable immediate mover entries |
| Win rate < 40% | Tighten both radar and movers confidence thresholds |
| 5+ consecutive losses | Reduce daily loss limit by 20% |
| Direction imbalance (e.g. longs losing) | Limit same-direction slots |
| Fees exceed gross PnL | **Emergency mode**: disable auto-entries, raise all thresholds |
| Profitable + healthy | Slightly relax thresholds toward defaults |

All adjustments have guardrail bounds — parameters can't swing wildly. Disable with `reflect_auto_adjust: false` in APEX config.

**Scheduled tasks** (built into APEX tick loop):
- **Daily PnL reset** at UTC midnight — clears daily loss tracking
- **REFLECT comprehensive report** at UTC 04:00 — full performance review with markdown report saved to `data/apex/reflect/`

---

### Production Safety

Built-in safety systems that protect positions even when the runner process crashes.

#### Exchange-Level Stop Loss Sync

Guard places a **trigger order directly on Hyperliquid** as a safety net. If the runner crashes, the exchange-side stop loss remains active. Synced on entry, tier ratchet, and startup — intentionally left in place on shutdown.

```
Position Entry → Place SL trigger order at Phase 1 floor
Tier Ratchet   → Cancel old SL, place new at higher tier floor
Position Close → Cancel SL trigger order
Runner Crash   → Exchange SL stays active (that's the point)
```

#### Clearinghouse Reconciliation

Bidirectional reconciliation between APEX slots and Hyperliquid positions. Detects orphaned exchange positions, orphaned slots, and size mismatches. Runs on startup and periodically via watchdog.

```bash
hl apex reconcile             # Check for discrepancies
hl apex reconcile --fix       # Auto-adopt orphans, fix sizes
```

| Discrepancy | Severity | Auto-Fix |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| Orphan exchange position | Critical | Adopt into empty slot + create Guard |
| Orphan slot (no position) | Warning | Mark slot closed |
| Size mismatch >10% | Critical | Update slot to match exchange |

#### Risk Guardian

Graduated risk response with three states and automatic transitions:

```
OPEN ──(2 consecutive losses)──→ COOLDOWN ──(trigger again)──→ CLOSED
  ↑                                  │                            │
  └──────(auto-expiry 30 min)────────┘                            │
  └────────────────────(daily reset)──────────────────────────────┘
```

| State | Entries | Exits | Trigger |
|-------|---------|-------|---------|
| `OPEN` | Allowed | Allowed | Default |
| `COOLDOWN` | **Blocked** | Allowed | 2+ consecutive losses or drawdown >= 50% of limit |
| `CLOSED` | **Blocked** | **Blocked** | Daily loss limit hit |

Exchange-level stop losses remain active in all states.

#### Rotation Cooldown

Anti-churn protection:
- **Minimum hold (45 min)** — Conviction collapse and stagnation exits blocked until 45 min. Guard hard stops and daily loss still override.
- **Slot cooldown (5 min)** — Closed slots can't be reused for 5 minutes.

#### State Archiving

Closed position state files archived to `data/archive/{YYYY-MM-DD}/` on close. Trade audit trail (`trades.jsonl`) is never archived.

```bash
hl apex archive               # Archive all closed state files
hl apex archive --days 7      # Only older than 7 days
hl apex archive --dry-run     # Preview without moving
```

#### ALO Fee Optimization

Entry orders default to **ALO (post-only)** for maker rebates (~3 bps savings per round-trip). Falls back to GTC if ALO is rejected. Exits and Guard closes always use IOC.

---

### Autoresearch-Powered REFLECT

Connects REFLECT to an autonomous optimization loop. A backtest harness replays historical trades against config variants, and an iterative agent loop finds parameter improvements.

```bash
python3 scripts/backtest_apex.py --config apex_config.json --trades data/cli/trades.jsonl
```

REFLECT auto-generates research directions:

| Finding | Suggested Direction |
|---------|-------------------|
| FDR > 30% | Raise `radar_score_threshold` in [170, 250] |
| Win rate < 40% | Sweep `pulse_confidence_threshold` in [70, 95] |
| Direction imbalance | Set `max_same_direction` to 1 |
| Healthy + profitable | Try lowering `radar_score_threshold` in [140, 170] |

---

```

---

## MCP Server

Expose all trading tools via [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) for AI agent integration.

```bash
hl mcp serve                      # stdio transport (default)
hl mcp serve --transport sse      # SSE transport
```

**16 tools exposed:** `account`, `status`, `trade`, `run_strategy`, `strategies`, `radar_run`, `apex_status`, `apex_run`, `reflect_run`, `setup_check`, `builder_status`, `wallet_list`, `wallet_auto`, `agent_memory`, `trade_journal`, `judge_report`

Fast tools (strategies, builder, wallet, setup, memory, journal, judge) call Python directly — zero subprocess overhead.

### HTTP API & SSE

Every deployed agent also exposes an HTTP REST API and SSE real-time feed for dashboards, monitoring, and external integrations. A separate leaderboard microservice tracks agent PnL rankings.

**[Full API Reference →](docs/api-reference.md)**

---

## Deploy on Railway

Two deployment options: **headless** (APEX runs strategies directly) or **OpenClaw agent** (conversational AI trading assistant with Telegram).

### Option A: Headless APEX (Deterministic)

One-click deploy to run APEX autonomously. No AI model needed — pure deterministic strategy execution.

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/new/template?template=https://github.com/Nunchi-trade/agent-cli&envs=HL_PRIVATE_KEY,HL_TESTNET,RUN_MODE,APEX_PRESET&HL_TESTNETDefault=true&RUN_MODEDefault=apex&APEX_PRESETDefault=default)

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `HL_PRIVATE_KEY` | Yes | — | Your Hyperliquid private key |
| `HL_TESTNET` | No | `true` | `true` for testnet, `false` for mainnet |
| `RUN_MODE` | No | `apex` | `apex`, `wolf` (alias), `strategy`, or `mcp` |
| `APEX_PRESET` | No | `default` | `conservative`, `default`, or `aggressive` |

**Run modes:**
- **apex** (default) — APEX multi-slot orchestrator with autonomous entry, exit, Guard trailing stops, and REFLECT self-improvement loop
- **strategy** — Single strategy loop (set `STRATEGY=engine_mm`, `avellaneda_mm`, etc.)
- **mcp** — MCP server for AI agent integration (SSE transport)

### Option B: OpenClaw Agent (Conversational AI)

One-click deploy of a full OpenClaw agent that uses our CLI as the tool backend. Talk to your trading bot via Telegram — it scans markets, enters trades, manages risk, and learns from its mistakes.

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/new/template?template=https://github.com/Nunchi-trade/agent-cli/tree/main/deploy/openclaw-railway&envs=HL_PRIVATE_KEY,AI_PROVIDER,AI_API_KEY,TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN,TELEGRAM_USERNAME,HL_TESTNET&HL_TESTNETDefault=true)

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `HL_PRIVATE_KEY` | Yes | — | Your Hyperliquid private key |
| `AI_PROVIDER` | Yes | — | `anthropic`, `openai`, `gemini`, or `openrouter` |
| `AI_API_KEY` | Yes | — | API key for the chosen AI provider |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Yes | — | Telegram bot token (from @BotFather) |
| `TELEGRAM_USERNAME` | Yes | — | Your Telegram @username |
| `HL_TESTNET` | No | `true` | `true` for testnet, `false` for mainnet |

**What you get:**
- OpenClaw gateway with web UI at `/openclaw`
- Telegram integration — chat with your bot to start/stop trading, run scans, check status
- Our 13 MCP trading tools as the agent's primary capabilities
- Persistent state across redeploys via `/data` volume
- Auto-onboard: bot sends "Agent ready" to Telegram on first deploy
- REFLECT self-improvement: the agent analyzes its own trades and adjusts strategy parameters

**How it works:**
1. Deploy sets up OpenClaw + our `hl mcp serve` as the tool provider
2. Bot auto-configures Telegram and sends you a ready message
3. Tell it "start trading" → it runs APEX with autonomous entry, exit, and risk management
4. Ask "how did we do?" → it runs REFLECT and reports performance metrics
5. The agent reads workspace files (AGENTS.md, SOUL.md) that define its trading behavior

Both options persist state via Railway volume at `/data` — APEX state, REFLECT reports, Radar history, and agent memory survive redeploys.

## Custom Strategies

Create a Python file that subclasses `BaseStrategy`:

```python
from sdk.strategy_sdk.base import BaseStrategy
from common.models import MarketSnapshot, StrategyDecision

class MyStrategy(BaseStrategy):
    def __init__(self, lookback=10, threshold=0.5, size=0.1, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(strategy_id="my_strategy")
        self.lookback, self.threshold, self.size = lookback, threshold, size
        self._prices = []

    def on_tick(self, snapshot, context=None):
        mid = snapshot.mid_price
        self._prices.append(mid)
        if len(self._prices) < self.lookback:
            return []

        pct = (mid - self._prices[-self.lookback]) / self._prices[-self.lookback] * 100
        if abs(pct) > self.threshold:
            return [StrategyDecision(
                action="place_order",
                instrument=snapshot.instrument,
                side="buy" if pct > 0 else "sell",
                size=self.size,
                limit_price=round(snapshot.ask if pct > 0 else snapshot.bid, 2),
            )]
        return []
```

```bash
hl run my_strategies.my_strategy:MyStrategy -i ETH-PERP --tick 10
```
